# Fluture loaders 

Wraps various loaders into [Fluture](https://github.com/fluture-js/Fluture) primitives.

Includes Xhr, as well as Audio, Blob, and Image helpers.

Typescript definitions are bundled in.

# Installation

`npm install --save fluture-loaders`

# Status

Not battle-tested yet...

# Usage

Probably easiest just to look at [the loaders](src/lib/loaders) directly :)
